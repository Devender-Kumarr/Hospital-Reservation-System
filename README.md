**Overview**
The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed and developed by Paris Rassani as part of their semester project. This system aims to streamline and simplify the management of patient and doctor records within a healthcare facility. Written in C, it combines practical functionality with ease of use.

**Key Features**

**Admit Patients:** This feature allows hospital staff to admit new patients effortlessly. Details such as patient ID, name, address, and disease are collected, and the admission date is automatically recorded. This ensures accurate and organized patient records.

**Patient List:** With the Patient List feature, users can access a detailed and well-structured list of all admitted patients. It provides essential patient information, including their names, addresses, diseases, and admission dates. This feature facilitates efficient patient management and retrieval of patient data.

**Discharge Patients:** Discharging patients is a crucial aspect of hospital operations. This feature enables staff to discharge patients based on their unique ID. When a patient is discharged, their record is removed from the system, ensuring an up-to-date and concise patient list.

**Add Doctors:** Managing medical staff is equally important. The Add Doctors feature allows administrators to add doctor information, including ID, name, address, and specialization. This feature enhances the ability to maintain an accurate database of medical professionals.

**Doctor List:** The Doctor List feature provides an organized view of all doctors within the hospital. It displays essential details such as doctor names, addresses, specializations, and registration dates. This feature assists in the effective management of the hospital's medical staff.
